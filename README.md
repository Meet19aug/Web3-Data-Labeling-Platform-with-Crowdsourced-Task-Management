## Project Title
**Web3 Data Labeling Platform with Crowdsourced Task Management**

---

## Project Description
This project is a Web3 SaaS platform designed for crowdsourced data labeling, tailored to Web3 use cases with secure, crypto-based payments. Leveraging Solana for transaction handling and AWS S3 for asset storage, the platform facilitates secure, decentralized task distribution and completion. Features include pre-signed URLs for secure uploads, payment verification on the Solana blockchain, and user-friendly interfaces for task management and worker payments.

## Features
- **Web3 and Solana Integration**: Supports crypto payments via Solana, with transaction handling and payment verification.
- **Crowdsourced Task Management**: Allows users to create tasks and enables workers to complete tasks, with seamless payment processing.
- **Secure User-Uploaded Content**: Utilizes AWS S3 for asset storage and pre-signed URLs to ensure secure uploads.
- **ML Model Support**: Components designed to support machine learning models for data labeling.
- **Authentication & Security**: Basic authentication, JWT setup, and best practices for private key management.

## Project Overview
This Web3 data labeling platform is designed for Web3 companies to streamline data annotation tasks, incentivizing contributors through crypto payments. It uses Solana to handle transactions, secure authentication, and AWS S3 with CDN for data distribution.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Meet19aug/your-project-name.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables for AWS, Solana, and database configuration.

## Usage
1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Access the platform at `http://localhost:3000` and follow the UI for task management, crypto payments, and data labeling.

## Components
1. **Backend**: Transaction handling, payment verification, and secure storage with S3.
2. **Frontend**: User interfaces for creating tasks, uploading assets, and wallet integration.
3. **Security**: Measures to protect against transaction vulnerabilities, with best practices for private key management.

## Security Considerations
- **Private Key Management**: Avoid storing private keys on EC2; use a secure key management service.
- **Payment Verification**: Ensures workers are paid accurately, leveraging Solana's blockchain for transparency.
